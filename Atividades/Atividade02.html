    <h2>Kasespatzel</h2>
    <hr>
    <p class="Kasespatzel">One of the most beloved of all Swabian dishes, Kasespatzle (German Cheese Spaetzle) is
    everything great comfort food should be! Chewy homemade Spätzle baked with gooey Swiss cheese and topped with
    caramelized onions, it’s on my most favorite dishes! </p>

    <h2>Currywurst</h2>
    <p class="Currywurst">Currywurst has been a German institution since its invention in Berlin in 1949 by Herta Heuwer.
    She lived in the British military sector of Berlin after World War II where some soldiers had given her some
    ketchup, curry powder and Worcestershire sauce that they brought with them from the UK. She went to work
    experimenting on a sauce that would provide much needed contrast to the limited post-war rations the people were
    accustomed to living on, a flavorful spicy sauce poured over Bratwursts hot off the grill that she would patent two
    years later. </p>
